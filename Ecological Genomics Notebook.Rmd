### Entry 1: 2020-01-13, Introductory Class.   

#### Ecological Genomics:
* species interactions @ genomic look. 

* Study of genes with relation to organims interacting with the enviroment.

* Inherently about evolution. 

#### Population Genetics:
* 1920s-1930s

* Sewall Wright and R.A. Fisher

* Mathematical Theory:

1.  A1A2

2. p + q = 1 (allele frequencies adding to 1)

3.  HWE: 1 = p^2 + 2pq + q^2

4. Whright-Fisher population: infinitely large, cloased and unfragmented, random mating, no natural selection

* When N is finite and there are sampling effects, genetic drift occur.

* Island Model: Multiple populations, subdivided but connected through migration.

* Fst= (var(p))/(mean(p)(mean(q)))

#### Selective Sweeps:

* 1970s: allozymes

* 1980s: PCR, microsatelltes, DNA sequences using Sanger's method

* M. Kimura, important architect of moleculat evolution field. 

* Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution.

* Probability of a new mutation 1/2N = mu and the the prbability of being fixed.

* dN/dS = (Nmutations/Nsites)/(Synonimous mutations/S sites) = w, if: 

1. w >> 1 w>2 there is positive selection

2. w = 1 neutral

3. w << 1 negative or purifying selections

### Entry 3: 2020-01-22, Second info-updates class.   

### My Info Update Presentation:

* Amplicon: Is a piece of DNA or RNA that is the source and/or product of amplification or replication events.

* In other words, is a segment of genetic material that undergoes simplification and contains replicated genetic material. Depending on what are you working with, amplicons can be direct repeat or inverted repeat, and can be linear or circular in structure. 

* Important: the term amplicon is often used interchangeably with PCR products.

* Amplicon sequences results in high coverage of a specific region, making amplicon sequences useful to detect variants at very low levels and frequencies. Also, it allows for multiplexing of samples.

* Useful for: genome targeting and detection  of hot-spot mutations, gene fusions, SNPs and in disciplines such as bacterial metagenomics or biodiversity assesments. 

### Steps:

1. Sample Selection: Environmental Samples. 

2. DNA or RNA extractions.

3. Library preparation:

3a. First PCR to amplify target genes with primers synthethized with a head sequence at the end.

3b. Optimal purification

3c. Second PCR to amplify products with primers that consist of the head sequence and include at the 5' end a library-specific barcode. 

3d. Purification with magnetic beads and stand.

3e. Once you get an equimlar amount of purified amplicons they are pooled.

4. Sequencing: Miseq Illumina Sequencing.


#### First in class coding:

[First coding tutorial](https://pespenilab.github.io/Ecological-Genomics/Tutorial/2020-01-22_Command_Line_Unix.html)

* Major calls: 

1. pwd : to know where do you live on the server

2. ~/ : same thing as typing /users/j/r/jruizaro

3. cd : change directory

4. mkdir : make directory

5. ll : to look what is inside directory

6. head : to look first rows of a document

### Entry 4: 2020-01-27, First paper discussion.   

[Temporal genomic contrasts reveal rapid evolutionary responses in an alpine mammal during recent climate change](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008119)

* Take Home Message: Environmental changes inluences demographic patterns with quantifiable changes to selection and genetic drift. 

### Common Vocabulary

1. Population Genomics: selection and drift across the genome. 

* Drift: demographic - changes in abundance and in distribution, cause by environmental changes.

* Selection: changes in selection.

* In population genomics, linkages and interactions are studied, in population genetics not. 

2. Looking across the genome is challenging cause signals can be undistinguishable. We need to separate and differenctiate the results that demographhic changes and selection leave at the genome.

3. Genomic environment is an environment by itself.

4. Linkage disequilibrium: non-random association of alleles at two or more loci in a general population. 

5. We expect selection to act locality and on a particular site with LD, while we expect drift to act globally (affecting the mean, variance and the diversity).

6. Demographic history: 

* Ne = effective population size, size where a population behave as if it were a W-F population.

* Smaller population size, greater the drift.

* Migration = gene flow among and between populationg.

* Divergence time. 

* Coalescent theory: probability of two random alleles copies sharing a common ancestor or accommon gene in the past.

* 2Ne allele copies in a population of Ne individuals. 

* We need to sample enough to capture the most recent common ancestor,

* If a population is changing in size, that will affect the rate of coalescence appearance. You can use this know understand the behavior of the population (ex: bottleneck, expansion, etc.)

* If Ne split = divergence, first you will see a lot of colescence and back in time it will slow down. 

* In a bottleneck, you will lose many of the rare lineages and retain common ones.

* Site-frequency expectrum.

7. Positive Selection

### Entry 5: 2020-01-29, Second Tutorial: Working with batch scripts.   

[Second Tutorial](https://pespenilab.github.io/Ecological-Genomics/2020-01-29_PopGenomics_Day1.html)

* Species of Interest: Red spruce. Tree species that has undergoes through latitudinal and elevational migration. Now there are unconnected and fragmentated populations in the top of the appalachians going from New York to South Carolina. 

* In our dataset, we are working with genomic DNA of 110 mother trees from 23 populations. 

#### Pipeline:

1. .fastq.gz, we will visualize them using FastQC.

2. trimmed.fastq, using Trimmomatic.

3. Visualize the post trimming.

4. Map or alignment to the references genome.

5. Map (or align) to the reference genome using bwa. File: .sam.

6. post.processing using samtools and sambamba. Making a binary file: .bam.

7. remove drops, stats

[Second Tutorial](https://pespenilab.github.io/Ecological-Genomics/2020-01-29_PopGenomics_Day1.html) 

* Because files inside RS_ExomeSeq are .gz, to see the individual file we can no use head.We use zcat instead, to see it without uncomprresing it: (zcat NAME) | head -n 4. 

* We will see the barcodes indexes (pair) with a four line with a quality encoding score called the Q score. 

* Phred Quality Score: 10 or < 90 % accuracy 20 or > more than 99% accuracy: example p=10^(-38/10)= prob(of the machine misscalling the nucleotide on the loci) = 0.0038.

#### Population assigned to me: WA. 

#### Step:

1. vim in myscripts

2. press i

3. #!/bin/bash

4. cd ~/Ecological_Genomics_2020/myresults/ 

5. mkdir fastqc

6. for file /data/project_data/RS_ExomeSeq/fastq/edge_fastq/WA*fastq.gz

6.5. do

7. Output file in /fastqc: fastqc ${file} -o fastqc/

8. Closing the loop: done

9. Exit editing mode: ESC, shift :, wq fastqc.sh

* To move files aroud: mv filename dir/ 

10. permision: -rw-r--r-- without x means file is not executable, then chmod u+x fastqc.sh.

11. bash fastqc.sh

12. Push everything and pull it bacj to your local repository.

#### Now, we are going to trim.

1. Using Trimmomatic.

2. Download from data/scripts and save it into my scripts: cp trim_loop.sh ~/REPOSITORY/myscripts/

3. Open it in vi (filename) nad edit your population name.

4. bash trim_loop.sh

### Entry 6: 2020-02-03, Second Paper Dicsussion   

### Info-updated

### Genomic diversity - How to calculated and what it does it say?

* Effective population size = population size of an ideal population that follows W-F assumptions.

* Factors deviating Ne from N: 

1. Non-random mating

2. Selection

3. Reproductive Skew 

4. Non-constant population size

5. Unequal sex ratio (Segwall Wright) <= Ne = (4Nm x Nf)/(Nm + Nf)

6. Can be estimated by previous formulas, but there will be other variables (ex. mutations, migration, etc.) which will end up affecting Ne.

7. nucleotide diversity (or pi) = 4(Ne or net probability difference in nucleotide) u (or mutation rate with units of changes per site per generation)

* Nei's genetic distance - measurement of diversity

* Fst (population structure) = 1/(pi + 1) (as pi increases Fst decreases, menas population is more homogenous)

* or Fst = 1 - (Hs (or average H of subpop.)/Ht (or average H for whole pop.))

* Heterozygozity (H): condition of having two different alleles at a locus.

* Site Frequency Spectrum: distribution of the allele frequencies of a given set of loci (often SNPs) in a population or sample. 

* Tajima's D: statistic that compares the average number of pairwise differences with the number of segregating sites. If = 0, in equilibrium, factors are not influencing too much. < 0 (expansion, we will have more rare alleles or more rare mutations appearing) or > 0 (contraction).  

### Paper Discussion (Evolution of sociality in spiders leads to depleted genomic diversity at both population and species level)

Take Home Message: How the transition to sociology can affect Ne? Non-random mating, Reproductive Skew, Unequal sex ratio.

* Fst = 1 - (average pi of subpopulation/ total species pi)

* lower K = more geneflow

* Inbreeding coefficient: how much inbreeding is happening.

* Migration push TMRCA further back in the past. 

* Social = total pi = 0.00056, Ne = 21 x 10^3

* Subsocial = total pi = 0.00474, Ne = 178 x 10^3

* mutation rate = 6.65 x 10^-9

### Entry 7: 2020-02-05, Third Tutorial   

[Third Tutorial](https://pespenilab.github.io/Ecological-Genomics/2020-02-05_PopGenomics_Day2.html)

#### Mapping cleaned and trimmed reads against the reference genome

[congenie](http://congenie.org/) to look for availability of reference genomes.

* wget -> to get genomes from the internet

* We are going to use a subsetted of the reference genome to include just the contigs that contain one or more probes from our exon capture experiment. 

* Average size of contigs <- 10.5 kbp.

* The N50 of the reduced reference is 101,375 bp (that particular contigs + biggers give of 50%). N50 take 50% of 668 Mb, and start from the biggest contigs moving back until we get 334 MB (N50 is the smallest contigs in which the sum of all larger contigs give of 50% of our total genome).

#### Wrapper

* mapping - aligment to reference genome

* bwa program: algorithm for mapping reads to references

* bwa mem -t 1 -M ${ref} ${forward} ${reverse} > ${output}/BWA/${name}.sam

* CTRL-A + Ctrl-D to let it running on the background

* screen -r to recover the screen

### Entry 8: 2020-02-10, Third Paper Discussion.   

### Info-updated

### GWAs (Genome Wide Association Studies)/ WGWAs (Whole)

* Genotype to phenotype retrospective studies.

* 2002 First WGWAs analysis performed : Microbial insfrection. 

* 3000 studies has been don't up to the year 2017.

* In medical studies: rare variants mapped to SNPs in the genome (Ex. diabetes, parkinson, etc.).

* Which SNPs are the most responsible to cause the genetic deseases. (With case control, simple comparison to see what genetic variants have the effect).

* Manhattan plot: SNPs are plot across the whole genome and we can statistically see which one show significant differences.

* Methodology for classic GWAs:

1. Making/finding population that differ in a singular trait

2. Using MAseq to generate data of genomic variance

3. Making statistical inferences

We end up finding:

1. Causal impact of the genetic variance: great.

2. Close to causal to genetic variance: good.

3. bias -> population bias: horrible. 

Problems with GWAs:

1. SNPs are not genes.

2. Low heritability of traits - distinctions can become unclear.

3. Ancestral association - problems in populations with smaller population sizes due to violation of WF assumptions. There is less recombination. We address this issue by fitting the data (to look for cofounding variables and taking out the variability created by the variable we are not looking into).

QQplots:

1. lambda: median empirically observed variation/median expected vaiation = 1 (good)

2. If lambda is bigger than 1, ecologist devide their lambda to the expected lambda and that decrease variability of the data.

Ecological source of errors:

1. Different methodology from human analysis.

2. Correlated traits: joint GWAs analyses. (PCA (represents genome wide ancestor) and genome control).

3. Trait-structure extrapolation. Causal association between SNPs and phenotypic traits, is difficult to study when effecive size and allele frequency are very high.

4. Significant treshold. Competition between acuraccy and broadness.

### Entry 22: 2020-02-11, Tuesday.   

[Tutorial](https://pespenilab.github.io/Ecological-Genomics/2020-02-12_PopGenomics_Day3.html)

Codes:

head WA_419.sam to see first lines of the file

tail WA_419.sam to see bottom of the file

[SAM FLAG DECODER](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/explain-flags.html): 147 (it means that the read was paired, mapped in proper pair, read reverse strand, second in pair)

In this "Decoder" we are looking to avoid not primarly alignment, if it fails quality control checks, etc.

Mapping quality score: higher the number, the better.

samtools flagstat give us basic information about pur files

*Ex: Total number of reads, number of reads paired in sequencing, etc.

To get that information for all of your files: 

All should have the extention: filename sorted.rmdup.bam and .bai.

Mine is rmup instead or rmdup.

Depth - The more reads you have, the more confidence you are going to be about the info you ae generating. Compared to reference genome.

To see mapping of a single individual:

samtools tview /data/project_data/RS_ExomeSeq/mapping/BWA/WA_419.sorted.rmup.bam /data/project_data/RS_ExomeSeq/ReferenceGenomes/Pabies1.0-genome_reduced.fa

Genotype likelihood: prob of observing sequenced data ...

Chenck in he ANGSD  with ll -rt to see if files are over there.

[Fifth Tutorial](https://pespenilab.github.io/Ecological-Genomics/2020-02-12_PopGenomics_Day4.html)

We are going to do folding to our site frequency expectrum. Folding the plot and moving all of the 2N high frequencies alleles to the beginning. This is because we don't know with allele is pur ancestor. 
Folded spectra: plotting the frequencies with the minor allele frequencies. 

Today we are going to:

1. Estimating (rough) SFS

2. .sfs

3. Estimate SFS using .sfs as a prior

4. doTheta (Parameter of population that describe diversity = 4Neu)

5. thetha_stats

R codes to generate stats: We obtained positive Tajima's D which means that a bottleneck occured before fragmentation.

### Entry 11: 2020-02-24, Fourth Paper Discussion.

Ecological Genomics: Intersection between population genetics, molecular evolution and ecology (biotic and abiotic enviroment).

Example: p*q, Coalescence theory, Nucleotide diversity, Tajima's D, SFS. Plus a ton of NGS.

Trancriptomics: Measuring genes expression when you hold/control enviromental conditions constant. To reveal genetically-control diiferences phenotypes at the molecular level. 

What is a phenotype? 
* Characteristics of an organism that can be observed. (eg. coat color (morphological scale), disease resistance/susceptibility (celular and molecular level)).

Central Dogma of Molecular Biology: DNA (transcription) ---> RNA (translation) ---> Protein ---> Phenotype

Transcriptomics act on the RNA section of our Dogma. 

Reverse ecology: to indicate the phenotype natural selection is acting on.

Examples: 

1. Mutations in coding/DNA that affects AA

2. Splice site variation

3. Promoter and enhancers affecting expression level and timing of expression, or cell/tissue type in which the genome expressed. Also, conditions of expression

4. Post-translational modifications (-P), at the protein level

5. Epigenetic modifications (can affect all of the above)

Transcriptomics give you an active vision of what it is hapening at a certain time. It is global/unbiased. And it is cheap (Illumina) and you can assembly a new (de novo) transcriptome.

Phenotype = G + E + (G x E). You can control environemnt and/or experimentally induce phenotype of interest. 

Molecular underpinnings of a phenotype. 

Factors to consider (Take into consideration your questions and hypotheses, they will affect factors): 

1. Common gardens - controlling enviromental conditions. 

2. Treatments/conditions - related to phenotype of interest. 

3. Populations

4. Tissue, cell

5. Life history

6. Transgenerational environment

7. Sex of organism and reproductive stage

Work flow:

1. Careful experimental design, considering our questions, hypotheses and factors

2. Experiment and sample tissues*individuals, save RNA - labile. Extract, prep, sequence (mRNA, 3'tag, other sequencing techniques)

3. Process + Analyze sequence data. Quality check -> Clean -> Qc (Working with .fastq). Map to reference + Extract count data. Normalize the variation among your samples. Count data matrix. 

4. Integrate: GO, Network analyzes, SNP, Tajima's D, microbiome data.

### Entry 12: 2020-02-26, Transcriptomics First Session.   
[Tutorial](https://pespenilab.github.io/Ecological-Genomics/2020-02-26_RNA-seq_Day1.html)

Goal: To assess the gene expression responses of Red spruce individuals from these habitats in response to experimental treatments of heat and heat+drought.

With the library prep and sequencing used, little RNA with good quality is enough to work. 

Possible questions to ask with this data set:
Factors:

1. Treatment: C, H, D

2. Source Climate: 2, HotDry and CoolWet

3. Time: 0, 5, 10

1) Do individuals from different climate sources have different gene expression:

* in each condition? ex ~ SC + trt

* at different time points? ex ~ time + source climate + (time*SC) + family 

* interactions ex ~ SC +trt + (SC*trt)

#### My sample will be: KAN D and KAN H
